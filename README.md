# PSYCHO DATA SQUAD!
**Analyzing Data Analyst Jobs Across America**

"Data Jobs in your Future. Where in America can your future take you?"*

4 Key Roles:
* Square - Git Hub & Initial Analysis 
* Triangle - Machine Learning
* Circle - create mockup of database with a set of sample data.
This is to ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project
* X - all of us - Which Technologies will we use?

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
-  Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 
-  Plotly will be used for graphs and further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. *We need a little more verbiage here.*

## Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on __________.  Javascript, Flask, HTML, CSS, Tableau, (possibly Heroku)

# RUBIC CATEGORIES GRADED EACH SEGMENT:  
# 1) GIT HUB Repository
A new repository has been developed with 4 branches, one for each team member. All 4 team members are committed to manage the changes, together, until we get the more practice at merging new code into older versions.
Once we have mastered the skills, we'll be ready for the final merge at the end of the project, with minimal risk of code loss or error.

Communication Protocols
Slack & Zoom meetings - working meetings and a growing number of individual assignments

# 2) PRESENTATION
## **Selected Topic**
Data Analyst Jobs in America by Geographic Location Analyzing a mix of factors to uncover any correlations.
Using a variety of tools, we will look at how jobs statistics look by state in the future. Our presentation can be found here [link to Google Slides] In the future we will develop the Dashboard(s)

OUR QUESTIONS and CURIOUSITIES about the DATA: 
* Data Analyst Jobs dataset originally scraped from GlassDoor API Questions we hope to answer with the data Data Jobs in your Future
* Is there a correlation between rating and salary offered by the company selected?
* Is there a correlation between the Type of Ownership (Private or Public, for example) and Salary?
* Is the a correlation between salary offered by location selected?
* Is there a correlation between company rating and option to Easy Apply?
* How well do these positions pay by Company Name, & Company Rating, Location (State), Job title, Industry, Type of Ownership, Salary Estimate (low, med, high? or something else),

INITIAL ANALYSIS will include graphs and charts that study this basic info about the data 
We will look at the some of the information we can get from cleaned table:
* Average and also median value for the ratings* of the companies very close to 4 (at round 3.9), it is a little bit more than overall job advertisements' rating average (3,7)
* Average minimum salary* is around 54K and median value for minimum salary is 51K. It is almost same with the whole data minimum salary mean and median. We can expect outliers from salary distribution and we acn also expect right skewed distribution of the minimum salary.
* Average maximum salary is almost 90K (89.97) and median value for maximum salary is 85K. MMedian value is less than whole data maximum salary median value. We can expect outliers from salary distribution and we can also expect right skewed distribution of the maximum salary.
* Average salary is around 72K, but still we can expect several outliers for this variable(min= 33.5K, max= 150K)

Interactive Webpage Dashboard (like BB) 
- Graphic across top,
   - 1 selection panel - pull down menu with all American States -select by state
   - 1 chart - BAR - Top 10 jobs for that state by Salary (top range)
   - 1 chart - BUBBLE - show the distribution of Jobs by Industry or Sector
   - 1 chart - GAUGE or something different
   - Dashboard 1 -- Tableau Our Tableau analysis can be found here [Tableau Dashboard].

   - Dashboard 2 -- an interactive webpage using machine learning to calculate....

Pull down menu by state

## **Reason for Selecting Topic**
We want to build a model that will predict the probability of getting a high paying job (3), medium paying job (2), and a lower paying job (1) in Denver, for example.
This information can be used by a Data Analyst looking for a Data Jobs because it will guide the Job searcher in their activities.

Description of the Source Data
 - Kaggle - narrowed the selection down to Data Analyst Jobs

# 3) MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
* NEED MORE WORK HERE     Machine Learning Model (Describe steps & results)
* Machine Learning Tools we plan to use
Imbalanced-learn
Scikit-Learn
Tensorflow and more
Tools

# 4) DATABASE INTEGRATION
Created Database Mock-up in 
PostgreSQL PgAdmin - see mock up in PgAdmin
Connecting to Database
(name of database) Use Mongo example like BB
