# Psycho_Data_Squad_1
edits as of 10/21/21 insert a cool graphic here and a team name too

##   1st Segment - Sketching it out
PSYCHO DATA SQUAD!
"Data Jobs in your Future. Where in America can your future take you?"

4 Key Roles:
* Square
* Triangle
* Circle - create mockup of database with a set of sample data.
This is to ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project
* X - all of us - Which Technologies will we use?
# 1) GIT HUB Repository
A new repository has been developed with 4 branches, one for each team member. All 4 team members are committed to manage the changes, together, until we get the more practice at merging new code into older versions.
Once we have mastered the skills, we'll be ready for the final merge at the end of the project, with minimal risk of code loss or error.

Communication Protocols
Slack & Zoom meetings - working meetings and a growing number of individual assignments

# 2) PRESENTATION
Selected Topic
Data Analyst Jobs in America by Geographic Location Analyzing a variety of correlations.
Using a variety of tools, we will look at how jobs statistics look by state in the future. Our presentation can be found here [link to Google Slides] In the future we will develop the Dashboard(s)

Interactive Webpage Dashboard (like BB) 
Graphic across top,
1 selection panel - pull down menu with all American States -select by state
1 chart - BAR - Top 10 jobs for that state by Salary (top range)
1 chart - BUBBLE - show the distribution of Jobs by Industry or Sector
1 chart - GUAGE or something different
Dashboard 1 -- Tableau Our Tableau analysis can be found here [Tableau Dashboard].

Dashboard 2 -- an interactive webpage using machine learning to calculate....

Link to the dashboard repository []
Pull down menu by state
 * possibly Link to deployed dashboard is herokuapp.com *

Reason for Selecting Topic
We want to build a model that will predict the probability of getting a high paying job (3), medium paying job (2), and a lower paying job (1) in Denver, for example.
This information can be used by a Data Analyst looking for a Data Jobs because it will guide the Job searcher in their activities.

How well do these positions pay by Company Name, & Company Rating, Location (State), Job title, Industry, Type of Ownership, Salary Estimate (top of range? or something else),

Description of the Source Data
 - Kaggle - narrowed the selection down to Data Analyst Jobs

Data Analyst Jobs dataset originally scraped from GlassDoor API
Questions we hope to answer with the data
Data Jobs in your Future

Is there a correlation between rating and salary offered by the company selected?
Is there a correlation between the Type of Ownership (Private or Public, for example) and Salary?
Is the a correlation between salary offered by location selected?
Is there a correlation between company rating and option to Easy Apply?
# 3) MACHINE LEARNING MODEL
Machine Learning Model (Describe steps & results)
Machine Learning Tools we plan to use
Imbalanced-learn
Scikit-Learn
Tensorflow and more
Tools

# 4) DATABASE INTEGRATION
Creating Database
PostgreSQL PgAdmin - see mock up in PgAdmin
Connecting to Database
(name of database) Use Mongo example like BB
